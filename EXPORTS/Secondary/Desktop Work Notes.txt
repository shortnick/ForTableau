GIS Data Engineer HomeworkAttached are 2 shapefiles – Airports and US States datasets.The Goal:  Using your favorite tools (like ArcMap or QGIS) and given the 2 input shapefiles, create output datasets that meet the following criteria, and are formatted as specified:Outputs:1) How many airports of type ‘mid’ are there in each of the 50 US states?  Calculate a column in the states shapefile that contains an integer count of the number of airports that fall within each state.  This shapefile should be in the 4326 projection and contain the new column called a_count.2)Create an airports dataset that only contains the airports that fall within the 50 states, and add a column that contains the name of the state as given in the states shapefile.  This shapefile should be in the Web Mercator (3857) projection.3)Create a .geojson file containing the United States as a single multipart polygon feature (output should not include states – combine the states to form the country feature).  This should be SRID 4326.Please check in the results to your Github account, and know that you will be expected to demonstrate and explain the steps you used to reach your conclusions during the follow-up in person meeting.Good Luck!Tasks1.1  Count of 'mid' airports in USA1.2 New integer column, a_count, in USA_admin1 with count per state1.3 Save seperately in 4326 projection. 2.1 Select all airports within USA2.2 Add column to ne_10m that has the name of the airport's state, as given by USA_admin12.3 Save as shapefile in Web Mercator (3857)3.1 Dissolve states layer into single national unit3.2 save as .geojson in SRID 4326Desktop Q?s Should the .shp in 1) contain only 'mid' airports or all USA airports?From 2) "name of the state as given in the states shapefile" as contained in field NAME_1 ? also, is there a prefered name for new column containing state name? Is the SRID in 3) supposed to be the current projection or Unpacked the archives (mac folder is artifact or misreading of archive file?)ne_10m_airports.prj = GEOGCS["GCS_WGS_1984",DATUM["D_WGS_1984",SPHEROID["WGS_1984",6378137.0,298.257223563]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0.0],UNIT["Degree",0.017453292519943295]]USA_admin1.prj = GEOGCS["GCS_WGS_1984",DATUM["D_WGS_1984",SPHEROID["WGS_1984",6378137.0,298.257223563]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0.0],UNIT["Degree",0.0174532925199433]]from the internal readme this file is based on public domain data, and satellite imagery. some locations are centroids, and there's +-20 mi accuracy. Opened both files in QGIS.  Seem to line up all right, based on an eyeball of SeaTac, Spokane, Boise, PDX?There's no .prj file for States? Nope, see second .prj lineSpot checks of the canadian borders have correct airports on correct sidesUsed Clip to grab all USA airports.
